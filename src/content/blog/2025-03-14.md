_"Thoroughness & Charm"_ is the first book by Mandi Gerth.

When Mandi returned to the workplace after a decade of staying home with her children, she realized there were two inherent tensions present in the job she had just accepted. First, she wanted to embody the noble ideas and biblical values of the Western tradition before her students.Second, she wanted to create and maintain joyful order in her classroom.

In _“Thoroughness & Charm,”_ Mandi shares how to navigate those tensions, sharing with you her insights which come from years of in-classroom experience. The culture of your classroom gives the curriculum its life. _“Thoroughness & Charm”_ helps you to better understand how to build classroom culture through embodied values, common language, and shared experiences. This shift in focus turns your classroom into a place that gives students a broader and deeper understanding of the tradition you represent and the curriculum you have been hired to teach.
